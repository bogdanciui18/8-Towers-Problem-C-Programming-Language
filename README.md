# The Eight Towers Problem

This application solves the Eight Towers Problem, which involves placing 8 towers on a chessboard in such a way that they do not attack each other. The implementation is done in C Programming Language. If the program is executed in a compilation environment, the result is displayed in the console and the backtracking algorithm is employed to find every valid solution.

## How To Use It

1. Run the code in a compilation environment.

## Tehnical Details

-Developed a C program to solve the Eight Towers problem.
-Employed the backtracking algorithm to find every valid solution.
-Created a Dockerfile to define the environment and build process.
-Set up a base image (Alpine Linux) . Alpine Linux images are known for being lighter and more resource-efficient compared to other distributions.
-Built a Docker Image.
-Ran the Docker Container
-Rebuilt the Docker Image
-Pushed to Docker Hub
